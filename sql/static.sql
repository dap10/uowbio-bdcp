Ten years later the Division became the Wollongong College of the University of New South Wales and, in 1975, the University of Wollongong was incorporated by the New South Wales Parliament as an independent institution of higher learning. In 1982, the University amalgamated with the Wollongong Institute of Higher Education which had begun life in 1962 at the Wollongong Teachers\' College. The merger formed the basis for a period of rapid growth in the 1980s and the emergence of the University of Wollongong\'s distinctive identity as an enterprising institution with a personalised style and a growing reputation for excellence in teaching and research.\nIn over 50 years, the University has grown from a provincial feeder college with 300 students to an international university with over 26,000 students spread across three campuses and five access centres. originally established as a provider of technical education for engineers and metallurgists required for the region\'s steel industry, the University now offers a wide range of courses across nine faculties-Arts, Education, Health &amp; Behavioural Sciences, Engineering, Law, Science, Informatics, Commerce and Creative Arts. \nUOW has developed into a multi-campus institution. The main Wollongong campus is on the original site five kilometres north-west of the city centre and now covers an area of 82.4 hectares with 94 permanent buildings and six student residences. The Dubai Campus in the United Arab Emirates was established in 1993 and the Shoalhaven Campus was opened in 2000 at Nowra on the New South Wales South Coast. In addition, there are University Education Centres in Bega, Batemans Bay, Moss Vale and Loftus as well as the Sydney Business School. The University also offers courses in conjunction with partner institutions in a number of offshore locations including Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong. \nThe University has always had a strong research focus and has developed an international reputation for its applied research (often in partnership with industry or government) in areas relevant to national economic, technological and social goals. It is home to eight Research Institutes and three ARC Key Centres for Teaching and Research-in Smart Foods, Bulk Solids and Particulate Technologies and Asia Pacific Social Transformation Studies. In addition, the University is a partner in four Co-operative Research Centres (CRC)-in Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, Railway &amp; Engineering Technologies, Welded Structures and Smart Internet Technology.\nThe teaching, research and cultural life of the University is supported by state-of-the-art facilities, including an extensive library collection, an interactive Science Centre, and a Recreation &amp; Aquatic Centre, In 2002, the University announced the establishment of a Wollongong Innovation Campus on a 20 hectare site at Brandon Park. A joint venture with the NSW government, the private sector and local councils, this science and technology will be developed over a ten year period commencing in 2003.\n</description>\n\n\n		<relatedInfo type="website">\n			<identifier type="http">http://www.uow.edu.au/</identifier>\n			<title>University of Wollongong</title>\n			<notes></notes>\n		</relatedInfo>	</party>\n</registryObject>\n</registryObjects>');

The BRL is committed to developing innovative strategies, based on rigorous applied biomechanics research, to decrease injury potential and optimise the quality of life for individuals of all ages. The dedicated research facility (11 x 6.5 m.) is equipped with state-of-the-art, sophisticated biomechanical measurement systems, which enable accurate qualification of human motion in both the laboratory and field-based environments. Equipment in the laboratory includes: \nOptoTRAK 3020 optoelectronic motion analysis system which can be integrated with our Kistler multichannel force platforms (400 x 600 mm) using Visual 3D software. This allows us to capture 3D movements and analyse performance and technique during sporting manoeuvres or conduct clinical gait assessments. We can also use digital video cameras or high speed video cameras (>210 fps), either inside or outside the lab, for the same purposes. \nNovel emed AT4 system to measure dynamic plantar pressures. \nNovel Pliance system can be used to measure pressure under various objects including bra straps and backpacks. \nNoraxon T900 telemetry EMG system to measure muscle activity and activation patterns. \nKinCom isokinetic dynamometer for muscle strength testing. \nChattanooga EMG Retrainer can monitor muscle activity while providing visual and audio feedback on set targets. \nInfoot 3D foot scanner determines individual foot shape characteristics. \nSonosite ultrasound system for musculoskeletal imaging. \nKinaesthetic ability trainer can be used for functional testing and training of neuromuscular control. \nPhysiological Profile Assessement to estimate falls risk. \nDynamic Cruciate Tester which is a instrumented knee laxity arthrometer. It can be used to measure knee laxity after cruciate ligament damage. \nCustom-designed monorail and harness system allows us to assess gait on slippery or uneven surfaces and on individuals at risk of falling. \nTreadmill can be used to facilitate continuous gait and breast motion analysis while running. \nThe BRL also uses LabView, MyoResearch, Visual 3D, ToolBench, SiliconCoach, Hu-M-an, Novel software, BioWare, MatLab and AutoCAD software for data collection and analysis.\n\n  </description>\n\n\n		<relatedInfo type="website">\n			<identifier type="http">http://www.uow.edu.au/health/brl/index.html</identifier>\n			<title>Biomechanics Research Laboratory (BRL)</title>\n			<notes></notes>\n		</relatedInfo>	</party>\n</registryObject>\n</registryObjects>');
